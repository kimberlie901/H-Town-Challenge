# Challenege 1: Horiseon Project

## Description

This Horiseon project was created for Challenege 1 Assignment. This challenege motivated me from the very beginning. As someone with a phsyiscally disabled family member, accessbility is something I think is important in everyday including web and technology accessibility. Accessbility is important for all businesses because never know what type of person is interacting with your business and your website. This was done by changing all the div elements that are not accessible and semantic to semantic elements such as header, nav, main, figure, and section. I also added alt to any img code I deemed necessary. 

## Installation
